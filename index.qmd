# Hi there, I’m Wesley!

I'm a graduate researcher at the University of Oregon, where I use GIS, remote sensing, and data science to investigate landscape change across different spatial and temporal scales, with a focus on boreal and temperate ecosystems. I recently completed a Master's degree in Geography, and my thesis investigated 25 years of forest composition change in Alaska using satellite imagery, machine learning, and simulation modeling.

## On this site, you’ll find:

-   Code snippets for spatial data analysis using R
-   Lab materials I’ve developed to support remote sensing and GIS instruction
-   Maps, posters, and links to research articles
