We will work through various standard remote sensing techniques in these labs. However, we will be focusing on one area of interest: Mount St Helens. This will enable us to tell a story using remote sensing methods while fine tuning our skills.

Labs might be updated up until their open date! Feel free to add to this collaborative Spotify [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6HDKT8XczetJ1liAdhLYXD?si=d995a7f86ac848b0&pt=1de65f5671589f0fcb4f375e36924022) so we have some tunes while we work.
